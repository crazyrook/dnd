###Cleric

Spellcasting p36

* As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for a selection of cleric spells.

Cantrips

* At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.

Preparing and Casting Spells

* The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

* You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

* For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

* You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
Spellcasting Ability

* Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

* Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

* Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Ritual Casting

* You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

Spellcasting Focus

* You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

Divine Domain p36

* Choose one domain related to your deity from the list of available domains. Each domain is detailed in their own feature, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

Domain Spells

* Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

* If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.

Trickery Domain p62

* Gods of trickery—such as Tymora, Beshaba, Olidammara, the Traveler, Garl Glittergold, and Loki—are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They're patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Their clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge, pranks, deception, and theft rather than direct confrontation.

* At each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.
* Trickery Domain Spells
* 1st charm person, disguise self
* 3rd mirror image, pass without trace
* 5th blink, dispel magic
* 7th dimension door, polymorph
* 9th dominate person, modify memory

Blessing of the Trickster

* Starting when you choose this domain at 1st level, you can use your action to touch a willing creature other than yourself to give it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. This blessing lasts for 1 hour or until you use this feature again.

Channel Divinity (1/rest) p36

* At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.

* When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your 
Channel Divinity again.

* Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.

* Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

Turn Undead

* As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

* A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

Divine Domain feature p36

* At 2nd level, you gain a feature from your Divine Domain.

Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity p62

* Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create an illusory duplicate of yourself.

* As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.

* For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.

Ability Score Improvement p36

* When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

* If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

Destroy Undead (CR 1/2) p36

* Starting at 5th level, when an undead of CR 1/2 or lower fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed.

Channel Divinity (2/rest) p36

* Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests.

Divine Domain feature p36

* At 6th level, you gain a feature from your Divine Domain.

Channel Divinity: Cloak of Shadows p62

* Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to vanish.

* As an action, you become invisible until the end of your next turn. You become visible if you attack or cast a spell.

Ability Score Improvement p36

* When you reach 8th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

* If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

Destroy Undead (CR 1) p36

* Starting at 8th level, when an undead of CR 1 or lower fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed.

Divine Domain feature p36

* At 8th level, you gain a feature from your Divine Domain.

Divine Strike p62

* At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with poison—a gift from your deity. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 poison damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

Divine Intervention p36

* Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

* Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

* At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.

Destroy Undead (CR 2) p36

* Starting at 11th level, when an undead of CR 2 or lower or lower fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed.

Ability Score Improvement p36

* When you reach 12th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

* If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

Destroy Undead (CR 3) p36

* Starting at 14th level, when an undead of CR 3 or lower fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed.

Ability Score Improvement p36

* When you reach 16th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

* If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

Cat's Claws.

* Because of your claws, you have a climbing speed of 20 feet. In addition, your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes.

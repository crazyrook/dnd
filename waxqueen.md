### Magical girl

Awakening!

* At 1st level, your inner magic has begun to bloom. This
“awakening” was brought on by your own natural aptitude
and your Heirloom, an artifact with deep emotional
attachments. This has resulted in a number of abilities and
traits that will grow as you advance, including your ability to
Transform! You gain access to the spell Find Familiar,
however the familiar cannot be permanently dismissed, nor
can its form be altered.

* Armor Class: While not wearing armor, your armor class is equal to 10+ your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier. You can
use a shield and still gain this benefit.

Transform!

* Your magical aptitude coalesces into a form ready for
combat, which you bring about by issuing a verbal or somatic
component as a bonus action. You must be in possession of
your Heirloom to Transform. At first level, you can Transform
up to two times per short or long rest. This increases to three
at 5th level, four at 9th level, five at 13th level, and six at 17th
level. The changes during this transformation can be minor
such as a simple clothing change, to something major like
completely altering your appearance and voice. The form you
choose affects nothing but appearance. You must choose a
specific form the first time you Transform, and this form
cannot be altered, barring dramatic character changes.
Armor Class: While transformed, you gain half of your
proficiency bonus rounded down to your armor class
(minimum of 1). Spells cannot increase your armor class
while transformed.

* Duration: You can stay transformed for up to one hour. If
you are knocked unconscious, it ends early.
Radiant Weaponry: When you transform, you may choose
to summon weapons from the list below.

 1. Up to two thrown weapons which, if thrown, at the
end of your turn dissipate and reappear in your hands.
 2. Any non-magical weapon which has the ammunition
property, which has unlimited ammunition.
 3. Two Light weapons.
 4. Up to two one handed weapons, or a one handed
weapon and a shield.
 5. A two handed weapon.  

* These weapons are made of radiant energy, and emit
bright light within 5 feet. These weapons deal Radiant
damage regardless of their type. They cannot be wielded by
anyone but you, and if they unintentionally leave your hands,
they dissipate immediately. They can be summoned again as
an action, or turned into another weapon from the list as a
bonus action. You are always proficient with your chosen
Radiant Weaponry

### Human

Languages.

* You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.

Feature: Criminal Contact

You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances; specifically, you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages for you.
